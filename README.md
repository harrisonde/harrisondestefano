## Getting Up to Speed
This [little diddy](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=little%20diddy "urbandictionary.com definition") is created by Harrison DeStefano and hosted by [pagodabox.com](http://www.pagodabox.com "Pagodabox's Homepage"). I suggest checking out the aforementioned, great PAAS. 

## The "Black Box" demystified
The [black box](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box "wikipedia tells all") or website is constructed with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. All the really fancy goodies are driven by Bourbon, Neat, Bitters, and Refils. Big thanks to the [thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com/ "Visit the gods of SASS") for maintaining and funding the project. Don't know where the development community would be with out folks like these!
