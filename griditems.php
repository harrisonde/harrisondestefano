    <h1>Why are you taking this course?</h1>
    <p>I am taking this course to lean more about the world of server side programming and PHP. I found the course description to be very exciting and thought I could learn a thing or two. Looking forward to the coming weeks of class.

    <p>I have a good bit of experience with HTML and CSS aka the structure and presentation layers of the web. My interest started when I was a young boy and now that I’m an old man - well I still have a lot to learn. I have constructed a few websites floating around the inter-webs. But, nothing to brag about</p>

    <h1>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h1>
    <p>I have a decent amount of programming experience - but nothing that I’d call amazing. I found the more you lean, the more you realize you do not know. So, bring on the knowledge!

    <h1>Describe your level of experience with programming.</h1>
    <p>I really like programming and enjoy the continued challenges it offers. I can’t say a project is complete as the internet is always evolving and with it so too does the code. I have spent the past few years coding for a number of folks, mainly HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
